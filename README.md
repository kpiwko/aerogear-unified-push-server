# AeroGear PushEE [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server)

AeroGear's Connectivity Server (Java EE poc)

### Some guidance

Starting the JBoss Application Server:

```
./bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
```

Deploying the server to JBoss AS using the jboss-as-maven-plugin:

```
mvn package jboss-as:deploy
```

***Note:** When testing functionality with the included webapp, it may be necessary to clear the browser's local storage occasionally to get accurate testing results. This is due to the client library storing channel information for later reuse after losing a connection (via refresh, browser close, internet drop, etc.) The functionality to cleanly handle this issue is in development and will be added soon thus removing the need for manual local storage cleaup. Consult your browser's docs for help with removing items from local storage.


#### Login 

Temporary there is a "admin:123" user...

```
curl -v -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt 
  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
  -X POST -d '{"loginName": "admin", "password":"123"}'
  http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/auth/login
```

#### Register Push App

Register a ```PushApplication```, like _Mobile HR_:

```
curl -v -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
  -X POST
  -d '{"name" : "MyApp", "description" :  "awesome app" }'
  http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/applications
```

_The response returns a **pushApplicationID** and a **masterSecret** that will be both used later on when you attempt to send a push message (either Broadcast or Selected Send)._

##### iOS Variant

Add an ```iOS``` variant (e.g. _HR for iOS_):
```
curl -v -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt 
  -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: multipart/form-data" 
  -F "developmentCertificate=@/Users/matzew/Desktop/MyDevCert.p12"
  -F "developmentPassphrase=TopSecret"
  -F "productionCertificate=@/Users/matzew/Desktop/MyProdCert.p12"
  -F "productionPassphrase=TopSecret"

  -X POST http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/applications/{PUSH_ID}/iOS
```

**NOTE:** The above is a _multipart/form-data_, since it is required to upload the "Apple Push certificate"!

_The response returns a **variantID** and a **secret**, that will be both used later on when registering your installation through the iOS client SDK._

##### Android Variant

Add an ```android``` variant (e.g. _HR for Android_):
```
curl -v -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt 
  -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
  -X POST
  -d '{"googleKey" : "IDDASDASDSA"}'

  http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/applications/{PUSH_ID}/android
```

_The response returns a **variantID** and a **secret**, that will be both used later on when registering your installation through the Android client SDK._

##### SimplePush Variant

Add an ```simplepush``` variant (e.g. _HR for Browser):
```
curl -v -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt 
  -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
  -X POST
  -d '{"pushNetworkURL" : "http://localhost:7777/endpoint/"}'

  http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/applications/{PUSH_ID}/simplePush
```

_The response returns a **variantID** and a **secret**, that will be both used later on when registering your installation through the UnifiedPush JS SDK._

#### Registration of an installation, for an iOS device:

Client-side example for how to register an installation:

```ObjectiveC
- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
  didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData*)deviceToken
    AGDeviceRegistration *registration =
    
        [[AGDeviceRegistration alloc] initWithServerURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"<# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #>"]];
    
    [registration registerWithClientInfo:^(id<AGClientDeviceInformation> clientInfo) {
        [clientInfo setDeviceToken:deviceToken];

        [clientInfo setVariantID:@"<Variant Id #>"];
        [clientInfo setVariantSecret:@"<Variant Secret>"];
        
        // --optional config--
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        UIDevice *currentDevice = [UIDevice currentDevice];
        
        [clientInfo setOperatingSystem:[currentDevice systemName]];
        [clientInfo setOsVersion:[currentDevice systemVersion]];
        [clientInfo setDeviceType: [currentDevice model]];

    } success:^() {
        // successfully registered!
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"PushEE registration Error: %@", error);
    }]; 
```

Check the [iOS client SDK page](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-ios-registration) for more information.

#### Registration of an installation, for an Android device:

For now, perform HTTP from Android to register the "Installation".
Here is a _CURL_ example for how to perform the registration:

```
curl -u "{variantID}:{secret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
   -X POST
   -d '{
      "deviceToken" : "someTokenString",
      "deviceType" : "ANDROID",
      "mobileOperatingSystem" : "android",
      "osVersion" : "4.0.1"
    }'

http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/registry/device
```

#### Registration of an installation, for a SimplePush client:

CURL example for how to register a connected SimplePush client:


```
curl -u "{variantID}:{secret}"
    -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
    -X POST
    -d '{
       "category" : "broadcast",
       "deviceToken" : "4a81527d-6967-40bb-ac56-755e8cbfb579"
     }'
http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/registry/device
```

The ```category``` matches the (logical) name of the channel; The ```deviceToken``` matches the ```channelID``` from the SimplePushServer.

**NOTE:** For _JavaScript_, an SDK is currently being worked on (see [AG-JS](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js/blob/Notifier-sockjs/src/unified-push/aerogear.unifiedpush.js))

### Sender

#### Broadcast Send

Send broadcast push message to ALL mobile apps of a certain Push APP......:

```
curl -u "{PushApplicationID}:{MasterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
   -X POST
   -d '{
       "staging":"development",  // if msgs should go to APNs Sandbox server (default: "production")
       "key":"value",
       "alert":"HELLO!",
       "sound":"default",
       "badge":7,
       "simple-push":"version=123"
     }'

http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/sender/broadcast
```

**TODO:** Add link to message format spec (once published)

#### Selected Send

To send a message (version) notification to a selected list of Channels, issue the following command:

```
curl -u "{PushApplicationID}:{MasterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
   -X POST

   -d '{
      "alias" : ["user@account.com", "jay@redhat.org", ....],

      "deviceType" : ["iPad", "AndroidTablet", "web"],

      "message": {"key":"value", "key2":"other value", "alert":"HELLO!"},
      "simple-push": { "SomeCategory":"version=123", "anotherCategory":"version=456"}
   }'

http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/sender/selected 
```

**TODO:** Add link to message format spec (once published)
